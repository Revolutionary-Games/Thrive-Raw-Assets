# OUTDATED Thrive-Raw-Assets

**All Thrive raw assets will now be uploaded to the ThriveDevCenter (access requires an account): https://dev.revolutionarygamesstudio.com/files/Raw%20Assets**

Please also see our workflow description: https://wiki.revolutionarygamesstudio.com/wiki/Workflow

### Old description
This repository has raw versions of assets used in [Thrive](https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive).

The main repository contains assets that Godot can import. This is not
always the best way to store the assets for future modification. As
such this repository contains assets in more "raw" form for easier editing.

The files are stored using git-lfs so you need that in order to properly clone this repository.

When creating a PR to Thrive that changes the assets, you should also
make a PR to this repo with the matching raw files, when
applicable. The raw files will allow other people to make small
tweaks to assets created by you.
