# Thrive-Raw-Assets

This repository has raw versions of assets used in [Thrive](https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive).

The main Thrive repository contains the imported (`.asset`) form of
the assets. Those can't be modified or reversed. So this separate
repository is for storing the source versions of the assets (blender
files, images).


The files are stored using git-lfs so you need that in order to properly clone this repository.

When creating a PR to Thrive that changes the assets, you should also
make a PR to this repo with the matching raw files. The raw files will
allow other people to make small tweaksto assets created by you.
